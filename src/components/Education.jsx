                I graduated from Senac Distrito Criativo, where I had my first contact with the world of technology through a technical programming course integrated with my high school education. It was during this experience that I discovered my passion for creating innovative solutions and fully immersed myself in software development. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Centro Universitário Senac, where I continue to expand my knowledge and technical skills.

                In addition, I participated in the Geração Caldeira 2024 program, promoted by Instituto Caldeira, an initiative that connected me with unique opportunities for learning and growth. During the program, I had access to courses on the Alura platform, where I earned 10 certificates of completion in various fields, solidifying my knowledge in different languages, tools, and development methodologies.
